Page Loading:

When a user opens an HTML page (index.html ), he sees the main heading "Betting DApp" and several sections on the page.
Token Staking:

In the "Stake Tokens" section, the user sees an input field labeled "Stake Amount" and a "Stake Tokens" button.
The user can enter the number of tokens that he wants to bet on staking.
After entering the amount, the user clicks on the "Stake Tokens" button.
Withdrawal of tokens and rewards:

There is a "Withdraw" button in the "Withdraw Tokens and Rewards" section. The user can click on it to withdraw their tokens and earned rewards.
User balances:

In the "Your Balances" section, the user's balances are displayed:
"Staked Balance" shows the number of tokens that the user has placed on staking.
"Rewards Balance" shows the number of tokens that the user has earned as a reward.
JavaScript (app.js):

When the page loads, JavaScript starts working.
JavaScript connects to the Ethereum network using the web3 library (or ethers.js ) and creates an instance of your staking smart contract using its address and ABI.
The updateBalances, stakeTokens and withdrawTokens functions interact with the contract to receive user balances, staking and withdrawing funds, as well as update the interface.
If the user is already connected to an Ethereum wallet (for example, MetaMask), the balances are displayed when the page loads. If the user is not connected, a message is displayed about the need to connect to the Ethereum wallet.
Connecting to an Ethereum wallet:

The user must be connected to their Ethereum wallet (for example, MetaMask) to use this interface. As soon as the user is connected, he can put tokens on staking, withdraw them and view his balances.
Smart contract:

This interface interacts with your Ethereum staking smart contract. The contract contains logic for staking, accrual of rewards and withdrawal of tokens.
So, the user can use this interface to stake their tokens, earn rewards and withdraw funds, all while interacting with your smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
